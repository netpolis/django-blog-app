<h3>Hakkımızda</h3>
<p>
    he HTML span element is a generic inline container for inline elements and content. It used to group elements for styling purposes (by using the class or id attributes), A better way to use it when no other any other semantic element is available. span is very similar to the div tag, but div is a block-level tag and span is an inline tag. Span tag is a paired tag means it has both open(<) and closing (>) tag and it is mandatory to close the tag.
